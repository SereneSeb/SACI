summary: Breathe is a modular housing prototype that offers compact, flexible, and sustainable urban living for mobile individuals in dense city environments.
description: Developed by students at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute for Lightweight Structures and Conceptual Design (ILEK), Breathe is a compact, modular housing prototype for urban nomads. It features a lightweight timber frame, minimal material palette, and passive design strategies to provide adaptable, small-footprint housing on unused urban plots.
community_model: While not intended for permanent residence, the prototype invites discussions around temporary occupancy, shared urban land use, and nomadic living in cities. It proposes a new kind of co-inhabitation for otherwise marginalized urban dwellers.

cultural_significance: Breathe challenges dominant paradigms of urban permanence and ownership. Its design language and lifestyle orientation reflect the needs of contemporary urban nomads—flexibility, adaptability, and spatial autonomy within a social fabric.
craftsmanship_materiality: Constructed from prefabricated timber frames, recycled fabric membranes, and lightweight partitions. The design minimizes embodied carbon while maximizing spatial efficiency and daylight access.
healing_design_principles: The project encourages freedom of movement, adaptability, and simplicity. Natural materials and an open, layered interior promote comfort, lightness, and a sense of autonomy for short-term dwellers.

### Summary  
Breathe is a modular housing prototype that offers compact, flexible, and sustainable urban living for mobile individuals in dense city environments.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Modular timber structure adaptable to small urban plots  
- Lightweight membranes and open partitioning  
- Passive daylighting and ventilation strategies  
- Compact design focused on simplicity and livability

---

### Ecological Function  
- Prefabrication minimizes construction waste  
- Recycled materials reduce embodied carbon  
- Designed for temporary, reversible urban use  
- Encourages efficient use of underutilized urban land

---

### Community Role  
- Prototype challenges norms of homeownership and permanence  
- Encourages cooperative use of unused or interim land  
- Can support seasonal, transient, or precarious urban dwellers  
- Suggests future potential for decentralized urban living networks

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- A critique of fixed, consumption-heavy lifestyles  
- Elevates mobility and adaptation as architectural values  
- Asks: What kind of shelter do we really need in the city?  
- Architecture as social provocation and spatial experiment

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Open, breathable spaces enhance sensory comfort  
- Natural textures and daylight contribute to emotional well-being  
- Scaled to human rhythm and soft material presence  
- Autonomy through spatial clarity and reduction

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Generated international attention as a housing provocation  
- Highlighted lightweight, ecological, and flexible construction methods  
- Inspired academic and civic debates around flexible urbanism  
- Informed broader discourse on micro-living and nomadic shelter

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Urban space can accommodate flexibility and mobility  
- Small-footprint housing can offer dignity and beauty  
- Modularity and prefabrication suit interim urban needs  
- Spatial minimalism can respond to both climate and lifestyle shifts
