summary: In Kurashiki, clean urban canals host koi and medaka fish, sustained by separated stormwater systems, stone-lined paths, and community-led care. Infrastructure becomes habitat, ritual, and relational memory.
description: Kurashiki’s open-air canal systems are a living testament to the quiet sophistication of Japanese water management. Built with stonework, garden integration, and biological clarity, they allow fish to thrive within a modern urban fabric. These waterways are not hidden or mechanized—they are cherished, witnessed, and cared for.
community_model: Neighborhood groups and families perform routine maintenance—removing debris, monitoring flow, feeding fish. This is stewardship without formalization, carried through civic pride and generational memory.

cultural_significance: The canals embody the Japanese ideal of *satoyama*—harmonious co-existence between human settlement and nature. Koi and medaka are not ornamental; they are animate witnesses of ecological health. Their presence signals social continuity and environmental trust.
craftsmanship_materiality: Stone-lined canals shaped over decades or centuries mirror temple architecture—precise, enduring, and reverent. Water gates, overflow channels, and bridges are crafted to age well and to sound pleasing when walked or heard.
healing_design_principles: The movement of water, shadows of fish, and moss along stone create a sensory field of calm. This is infrastructure that lowers stress, restores rhythm, and reattunes urban space to the pulse of nature.

### Summary  
In Kurashiki and other Japanese cities, ornamental fish like koi and medaka thrive in open-air drainage canals. These clean, biologically active waterways reflect a sophisticated water management strategy that separates stormwater and sewage, allowing for ecological function within urban space.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Stormwater-only drainage system  
- Stone-lined canal beds and banks for flow clarity  
- Overflow zones integrated with gardens and pedestrian paths  
- Routine maintenance embedded in daily life, not outsourced

---

### Ecological Function  
- Habitat for fish, birds, and aquatic plants  
- Natural mosquito control and waste filtration  
- Microclimate moderation through evaporative cooling  
- Continuous flow prevents stagnation and eutrophication

---

### Community Role  
- Residents inspect, clean, and tend to the waterways  
- Children feed fish, elders teach seasonal rhythms  
- Waterways form neighborhood anchors and paths  
- Collective care reinforces social cohesion

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Koi represent perseverance, peace, and grace under pressure  
- Water is sacred—a mirror, a flow, a promise of life  
- *Satoyama* values turn infrastructure into ritualized ecology  
- These canals are memory corridors, aesthetic rituals, and shared breath

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Sound of running water reduces urban stress and attunes nervous systems  
- Visual presence of fish and reflection engages multisensory regulation  
- Infrastructure is touchable, readable, intimate—not anonymous  
- Walking by the canal is a civic meditation

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Model for visible, low-tech ecological infrastructure  
- Enhanced biodiversity and seasonal awareness in urban zones  
- High community satisfaction and engagement  
- Inspiration for city-level water separation strategies worldwide

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Water infrastructure can also be cultural infrastructure  
- Design maintenance into the social contract, not the service contract  
- Visibility invites responsibility—when water is seen, it is loved  
- Ecology can coexist with urbanism through care and clarity
