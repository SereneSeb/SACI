summary: WikiHouse is an open-source modular housing system that empowers communities to digitally fabricate and assemble their own sustainable buildings.
description: Initiated in the UK, WikiHouse is a decentralized construction system using digitally cut timber components and open-source design files. It enables communities to design, share, and build their own low-cost, high-performance structures using CNC milling machines and local materials. The system redefines architecture as a distributed commons rather than a commodity.
community_model: Designed to be built by communities themselves, often in workshops or cooperatives. Emphasizes local fabrication, knowledge exchange, and democratized access to shelter. Some iterations are led by NGOs, housing advocates, or climate-responsive design labs.

cultural_significance: WikiHouse radically decentralizes the means of building, shifting architecture from an elite service to a civic tool. It reflects a post-capitalist ethos of commons-based production, open knowledge, and planetary stewardship.
craftsmanship_materiality: Uses CNC-milled plywood or OSB panels that snap and slot together, eliminating the need for traditional heavy machinery. Combines precision digital fabrication with manual assembly and on-site adaptability.
healing_design_principles: Participatory building processes generate empowerment and ownership. Structures prioritize daylight, breathable materials, and thermal comfort, promoting well-being from the construction phase onward.

### Summary  
WikiHouse is an open-source modular housing system that empowers communities to digitally fabricate and assemble their own sustainable buildings.

---

### Design Strategy  
- CNC-milled modular timber components  
- Parametric design templates shared freely online  
- Local customization based on climate and context  
- Assembly without cranes or toxic adhesives

---

### Ecological Function  
- Material-efficient fabrication with low-waste output  
- Timber construction with carbon-sequestering potential  
- Adaptable to passive solar strategies and site-specific ventilation  
- Encourages reuse and upgrade rather than demolition

---

### Community Role  
- Built by communities in participatory workshops  
- Fosters knowledge transfer and local resilience  
- Often deployed in underserved or transitional communities  
- Challenges centralized production and housing monopolies

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Architecture as open knowledge  
- Technology as civic empowerment  
- Design as a collective language and process  
- Challenges industrialized housing as the only future

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Breathable interiors with timber and natural linings  
- Empowerment through participatory design and self-build  
- Structures scaled to humans, families, and neighborhoods  
- Encourages relationship to material, place, and community

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Used in disaster relief, transitional housing, and urban prototypes  
- Active global network of designers, makers, and facilitators  
- Democratizes sustainable construction knowledge  
- Serves as a civic platform for architectural experimentation

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Housing can be a commons  
- Design literacy is a social right  
- Modular systems don’t have to be sterile or commodified  
- Distributed fabrication supports sovereignty and adaptation
