summary: Y:Cube is a prefabricated, modular housing system developed by YMCA and Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners to address transitional housing needs in London.
description: Y:Cube Housing offers low-cost, rapidly assembled modular homes for people moving out of homelessness or temporary accommodation. Built in a factory using renewable materials, the modules are designed to be self-contained, stackable, and energy-efficient. Each 26m² unit includes a living area, bathroom, and kitchen, providing an independent yet community-integrated living experience.
community_model: Developed by YMCA as part of a transitional support model, Y:Cube offers residents affordable rent, access to social services, and a stepping stone toward permanent housing. It supports dignity and autonomy within a supportive housing framework.

cultural_significance: Y:Cube represents a pragmatic and compassionate response to housing precarity. It challenges the notion that low-cost housing must be low-quality, showing how modularity and design intelligence can restore dignity and agency.
craftsmanship_materiality: Constructed using volumetric offsite modular construction with timber and composite panels. High thermal insulation and acoustic performance support comfort in compact living spaces. Units are craned into place and fully inhabitable within hours.
healing_design_principles: The secure, self-contained design restores autonomy and control for residents in transition. Natural light, insulation, and acoustic quiet support mental and emotional recovery. Community placement fosters a gentle re-entry into social life.
