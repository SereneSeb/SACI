summary: Woodside Care Village is a residential dementia care community designed around freedom, familiarity, and safety. It offers neighborhood-style living with therapeutic gardens and inclusive care.
description: Located in Warwick, UK, Woodside Care Village departs from traditional nursing homes by designing households around cultural and social familiarity. Each household is themed to match life histories and personal identities of the residents—such as 'Festival Walk', 'Aviary Court', and 'Market Street'. Architecture and care work together to support dignity, autonomy, and memory.
community_model: Residents live in grouped households supported by consistent care staff. Family members are encouraged to participate, and community events are open to public interaction. A mini high street, café, gardens, and salons offer structured spontaneity and shared rhythms.

cultural_significance: By aligning built space with memory, culture, and identity, Woodside Care Village reframes dementia not as disappearance—but as a different continuity. Design becomes biography made spatial.
craftsmanship_materiality: Constructed using brick, timber, and residential-scale materials to emulate familiar British neighborhoods. Interior finishes include domestic textures—curtains, wallpaper, soft upholstery—evoking a sense of home over institution. Outdoor paths use tactile paving and visual markers for intuitive navigation.
healing_design_principles: Design encourages movement, sensory engagement, and independence. Wayfinding cues, neighborhood clustering, garden loops, and routine spaces reduce anxiety and support emotional and relational continuity.
