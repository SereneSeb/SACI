summary: TECLA is a fully 3D printed, biodegradable housing prototype made from local earth, designed as a model for climate-resilient and circular housing.
description: Developed by WASP in collaboration with Mario Cucinella Architects, TECLA (Technology + Clay) is the world’s first 3D printed house made entirely from raw, local earth. Using a Crane WASP printer, the double-dome design optimizes passive thermal regulation and structural stability. The structure is completely biodegradable and recyclable, representing a post-capitalist approach to shelter for climate-affected communities.
community_model: While developed as a prototype, TECLA envisions decentralized, hyper-local housing strategies, where communities use local soils and open-source printing systems to self-construct resilient dwellings. It proposes an alternative to globalized, extractive construction.

cultural_significance: TECLA offers a new narrative for architectural production—one that merges ancient materials with digital fabrication. It questions waste, permanence, and ownership, positioning architecture as a soil-based, adaptable, and circular act.
craftsmanship_materiality: Constructed entirely from a mix of local clay, rice husk, and water. 3D printed in layers using a continuous extrusion system. No concrete, steel, or industrial insulation required. Celebrates the tactility of earth with the precision of algorithmic form.
healing_design_principles: The form and materials of TECLA offer sensory softness, breathable walls, and earthen tactility. Its quiet circularity and off-grid independence create a psychologically safe and ecologically grounded space for future living.

---

### Community Role  
- Designed for replicability and local adaptation  
- Low-cost housing solution for climate-affected regions  
- Proposes a regenerative alternative to global housing markets  
- Can be deployed rapidly in post-disaster or migration contexts

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Reclaims earth as a high-tech and sacred material  
- Merges ancestral building knowledge with digital tools  
- Form echoes traditional dome and hut typologies  
- Architecture as care, not commodity

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Natural materials create sensory warmth and safety  
- Acoustic dampening and thermal buffering promote calm  
- Off-grid autonomy fosters resilience and self-determination  
- Circularity reflects ecological wholeness

---
