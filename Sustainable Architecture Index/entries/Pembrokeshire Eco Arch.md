summary: A hand-crafted, earth-sheltered home built with salvaged materials and devotion to ecological living—part of Lammas Ecovillage and featured on Grand Designs.
description: Built by Simon and Jasmine Dale in Wales, this self-built dwelling uses a timber arch frame, straw bale insulation, and an earth-covered roof to create a deeply integrated home. Entirely constructed with hand tools and found materials, it serves as a powerful critique of mainstream housing, and a celebration of place-based sufficiency.
community_model: Part of the Lammas Ecovillage—a cooperative network of self-builders and low-impact residents governed under Wales’ One Planet Development policy. Labor, land, and learning are shared across the community fabric.

cultural_significance: "The house evokes Celtic myth—the hill as shelter, the arch as gesture of return. It embodies a refusal: of alienation, extraction, and bureaucratic stasis. Instead, it anchors life in touch, care, and story."
craftsmanship_materiality: Built with a single parabolic timber arch; straw bale walls; turf and earth roof. Materials are salvaged or site-sourced—reclaimed windows, natural renders, hand-cut joinery. Every element is traceable, held, and known.
healing_design_principles: Spatial quietude, enclosure, and tactility create emotional grounding. The act of building became a form of healing—a return to agency, family coherence, and landscape intimacy.

### Summary  
A hand-crafted, earth-sheltered home built with salvaged materials and devotion to ecological living—part of Lammas Ecovillage and featured on Grand Designs.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Single-span timber arch provides shelter and interior openness  
- Straw bale walls offer thermal mass and insulation  
- Turf and earth roof integrates the home into the landscape  
- Designed and built using hand tools, informal knowledge, and deep ecological ethics

---

### Ecological Function  
- Minimal embodied energy through reclaimed materials  
- Passive thermal regulation through straw, earth, and orientation  
- Rainwater catchment, compost toilets, and woodstove heating  
- No external services—fully self-reliant

---

### Community Role  
- Prototype for the One Planet Development framework  
- Part of a cooperative village: shared labor, governance, and food systems  
- Source of regional inspiration and political advocacy for low-impact housing

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- A literal “house in the hill” drawn from Welsh folklore  
- The arch as a symbolic womb—birthplace of self-determined dwelling  
- An architecture of refusal and care—tenderly radical, radically tender

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Built to hold a young family with care, simplicity, and autonomy  
- Touch, pace, light, and enclosure curated for nervous system regulation  
- Participatory building process fostered emotional resilience and relational healing

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Widely celebrated via Grand Designs and ecological housing forums  
- Influenced discourse around housing justice, planning reform, and land access  
- Became an emblem of hands-on sustainability and post-capitalist design vision

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- A single structure can spark a movement when built with integrity  
- Regulation and rebellion can converge in frameworks like One Planet  
- Architecture begins not with budget—but with intention, relationship, and trust
