summary: A pioneering timber housing project that redefines sustainability, material culture, and public-private cooperation in dense Nordic cities.
description: Cederhusen is Sweden’s largest urban residential project built in mass timber, developed by Folkhem and designed by General Architecture. It embodies the future of sustainable urban living—prioritizing carbon reduction, biophilic materiality, and quiet spatial dignity in a modern Scandinavian idiom.
community_model: Initiated through a strong public-private partnership under Sweden’s climate-forward building regulations. The project models how housing, government policy, and material innovation can align to build civic trust and long-term livability.

cultural_significance: Timber has long been a spiritual and domestic material in Scandinavian cultures. Cederhusen restores this vernacular logic in a contemporary urban form, echoing traditions of forest stewardship and simple, luminous spaces.
craftsmanship_materiality: Built almost entirely from Swedish spruce and fir, the structure uses CLT (cross-laminated timber) for its primary frame. Interiors are left exposed—offering warmth, scent, and grain as a daily experience of natural tactility and spatial softness.
healing_design_principles: Natural wood interior finishes reduce stress, support healthy indoor air, and regulate humidity. Operable windows and quiet sound profiles foster restful sleep and spatial calm. The material itself—slow-grown and locally harvested—invites an embodied connection to time and land.

### Summary  
A pioneering timber housing project that redefines sustainability, material culture, and public-private cooperation in dense Nordic cities.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Structural and envelope systems built entirely in mass timber  
- Emphasis on breathable, biophilic interiors with passive performance  
- Highly energy-efficient glazing and rooftop plantings  
- Modular planning and rapid on-site assembly with minimal waste  
- Fire-resilient design integrated into every component

---

### Ecological Function  
- Mass timber sequesters more carbon than it emits  
- Local forestry ties construction to sustainable landscape management  
- Exposed interiors reduce need for finishing materials, adhesives, and VOCs  
- Roof gardens and courtyards improve stormwater retention and biodiversity

---

### Community Role  
- Developed in collaboration with Swedish housing agencies and private investors  
- Shows that ecological excellence is possible at scale within market frameworks  
- Residents report high satisfaction, increased wellbeing, and spatial quietude  
- A landmark example of design as public trust

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Evokes the Nordic cabin—reimagined for modern cities  
- Restores the narrative of wood as a civic, not just rural, material  
- A poetic response to steel-and-glass anonymity through tactility and climate resonance

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Daylight-rich units reduce stress and enhance circadian balance  
- Mass timber interiors modulate acoustics and temperature  
- Breathable materials and quietness of form support psychological rest  
- Housing becomes not just shelter—but care infrastructure

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Over 240 apartments built in the heart of Stockholm  
- National model for mass timber in residential construction  
- Recognized for carbon-negative footprint and biophilic interiors  
- Strengthened political will for timber-focused building policy

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Cities can scale sustainability without aesthetic or emotional compromise  
- Mass timber allows for speed, precision, and poetic intimacy  
- Housing must balance material logic, civic trust, and ecological care
