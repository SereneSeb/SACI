summary: Tamera is a post-collapse prototype community based on cooperation, permaculture water systems, solar technologies, and social healing. It redefines infrastructure as care and architecture as peacework.
description: Founded in response to ecological and social collapse, Tamera is a 200-person ecovillage in southern Portugal organized around the principles of regenerative living, spiritual ecology, and nonviolent cooperation. Its solar test field, water retention landscape, and architecture of trust form a living system—where the built environment supports both ecological stability and emotional restoration.
community_model: Resident-led decision-making, land-based cooperatives, and educational programming through the Global Campus. Tamera runs as a living experiment in decentralized governance, long-term peacebuilding, and cultural healing.

cultural_significance: Tamera is not just a village—it is a sanctuary blueprint for the future. A site of planetary rehearsal, where collapse becomes compost for renewal. Architecture becomes rhythm, refuge, and ritual.
craftsmanship_materiality: Structures are built from adobe, natural plaster, rammed earth, timber, and recycled materials. The solar test field uses mirrors, parabolic troughs, and earth-integrated systems. Interiors feature handmade mosaics, open-air courtyards, and sacred geometry forms that guide spatial flow.
healing_design_principles: Spaces support emotional decompression, relational rituals, and environmental synchronization. Round structures, soft acoustics, communal thresholds, and proximity to flowing water create calm and clarity—aligning body, space, and social field.

### Summary  
Tamera is a post-collapse prototype community based on cooperation, permaculture water systems, solar technologies, and social healing. It redefines infrastructure as care and architecture as peacework.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Solar technologies (cooking, thermal, electric) integrated with water systems  
- Permaculture landscapes designed for water retention and biodiversity  
- Architecture avoids right angles in favor of soft organic geometries  
- Cultural spaces (peace garden, healing domes, community kitchen) function as social anchors

---

### Ecological Function  
- Restored degraded land through keyline design and terraced water bodies  
- Energy independent via solar concentrators and PV systems  
- Compost toilets, greywater systems, and local food loops  
- Regenerative rather than sustainable—aiming to heal ecosystems and consciousness

---

### Community Role  
- 200+ residents practicing shared labor, governance, and education  
- Global learning network through the Tamera Global Campus  
- Intergenerational and intercultural exchange rooted in lived peacebuilding  
- Rituals of arrival, conflict transformation, and gratitude embedded in spatial rhythms

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Solar energy as symbol of future care, not extraction  
- Buildings shaped by sacred geometry to foster coherence  
- Public space designed for eye contact, shared breath, and collective ritual  
- A re-enchantment of rural life, not nostalgia

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Quiet materials and acoustics reduce stress responses  
- Proximity to water, trees, and sky curated into each dwelling cluster  
- Social layout supports intentional encounter and voluntary retreat  
- Architecture becomes vessel for vulnerability and restoration

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Hosts thousands of students and activists annually  
- International influence on peace villages and water retention landscaping  
- Proven model for post-collapse resilience and trauma-informed design  
- Deep cultural relevance to planetary healing movements

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Regenerative villages must address psyche, soil, and society simultaneously  
- Healing is spatial, social, and metabolic—requiring infrastructure of care  
- Radical architecture emerges from lived experiment, not blueprint  
- Futureproof design means systems of trust, not just technology
