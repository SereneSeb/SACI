summary: The Hogeweyk is a dementia village designed to simulate normal life through architectural familiarity, spatial routine, and relational care. It reframes care infrastructure through healing design principles and community integration.
description: Located near Amsterdam, The Hogeweyk is a self-contained village for residents with severe dementia. It includes 23 houses, a supermarket, theater, café, and streets that support the illusion of everyday life—without the stress of exposure or disorientation. The design centers the agency, dignity, and rhythm of each resident’s lived experience.
community_model: Staff, caregivers, and families participate in a relational model of care. There are no white coats or institutional signs. Each household has a consistent care team trained in both clinical practice and emotional presence. Care is embedded—not broadcast.

cultural_significance: The Hogeweyk challenges how society spatializes aging and decline. It offers a new kind of commons—one that honors memory, routine, and the healing properties of the everyday.
craftsmanship_materiality: Designed with brick façades, clear sightlines, and home-scale construction to mimic familiar Dutch neighborhoods. Materials such as cobblestone, wood accents, domestic-scale doors and windows, and non-institutional lighting are carefully curated to invoke emotional safety and spatial familiarity. Tactile elements—wooden banisters, soft textiles, garden soil—help restore sensory grounding.
healing_design_principles: Spatial scale is carefully calibrated to prevent overwhelm. Multisensory engagement (flowers, birdsong, seasonal food, touch) supports emotional regulation. Predictability and spatial memory help reduce anxiety. Architecture becomes companion and co-therapist.

### Summary  
The Hogeweyk is a dementia village designed to simulate normal life through architectural familiarity, spatial routine, and relational care. It reframes care infrastructure through healing design principles and community integration.

---

### Design Strategy  
- 23 domestic-scaled homes arranged along pedestrian streets  
- Public square, theater, grocery store, and green spaces  
- Care teams assigned per house, maintaining resident continuity  
- Street and house types reflect different cultural backgrounds and lifestyles  

---

### Ecological Function  
- Gardens support seasonal engagement and food growing  
- Natural light, fresh air, and quiet zones support health and mood  
- Tactile and olfactory cues from landscape provide navigational markers  
- Aging in place reduces transitions, trauma, and environmental burden  

---

### Community Role  
- Residents participate in daily routines with autonomy  
- Neighborhood design invites volunteers, family visits, and interaction  
- Built to resemble a Dutch village to maintain continuity of cultural memory  
- Reduces institutionalization stigma and fosters relational connection  

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- “Village” over “facility” reframes the moral architecture of care  
- Daily rituals as cultural inheritance: baking bread, sweeping, sitting by the garden  
- Redesigns eldercare as shared life—not deferred death  
- Architecture becomes love translated into form  

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Familiar settings reduce cognitive load and anxiety  
- Homes enable social rhythm and domestic identity  
- Gardens and open paths invite motion, freedom, and reconnection  
- Environment promotes mental stability without requiring memory

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Reduced use of psychotropic medications and restraint  
- Increased resident happiness, orientation, and longevity  
- Internationally recognized as a model for neurodiverse design  
- Influenced care village prototypes in Germany, Canada, and Australia  

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Healing architecture requires attention to routine, memory, and multisensory support  
- Design must follow the logic of lived experience, not just medical protocol  
- A small-scale village can carry planetary significance  
- Emotional safety is a design achievement—not just a clinical one
