craftsmanship_materiality: Housing and public structures use warm façades, natural textures, and vernacular French village detailing. Paths, porches, and gardens are designed for sensory cueing, with soft thresholds and tactile navigation throughout.
healing_design_principles: Sensory orientation (sound, color, texture), rhythmic spatial patterns, and community presence enable emotional regulation and cognitive support. The built environment holds memory when memory falters.
