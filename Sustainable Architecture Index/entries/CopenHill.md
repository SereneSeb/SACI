summary: A waste-to-energy plant transformed into a public ski slope and park—CopenHill reimagines infrastructure as civic playground and ecological statement.
description: "CopenHill, designed by BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group), is a power plant that incinerates waste while generating energy for 150,000 Danish homes. But it’s also a rooftop ski slope, a hiking trail, a climbing wall, and a city-scale provocation: what if utility was also joy? What if the most carbon-intensive buildings were also invitations to play, reflect, and rewild?"
community_model: Developed through public-private partnership, the project is owned by ARC (Amager Resource Center) and welcomes citizens year-round. Recreation merges with utility—giving visibility, beauty, and engagement to what is often hidden and disavowed.

cultural_significance: "CopenHill is a symbolic inversion: what is usually considered polluting infrastructure is made transparent, beautiful, and civic. It asks: Can even our mistakes be turned into invitation? Can architecture digest guilt and return it as joy?"
craftsmanship_materiality: Clad in anodized aluminum bricks, the building gleams with an engineered elegance. Its roof is surfaced with synthetic turf and plastic bristles for year-round skiing. Interiors are fully visible—machinery becomes choreography, not secret.
healing_design_principles: "The building opens the industrial to the public—allowing bodies to move across it, over it, through it. It creates visual connection, green space, movement, and play in a high-emission sector. The result: reduced anxiety, greater civic intimacy, and landscape-scale re-perception."

### Summary  
A waste-to-energy plant transformed into a public ski slope and park—CopenHill reimagines infrastructure as civic playground and ecological statement.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Converts 440,000 tons of waste annually into clean energy and district heating  
- Rooftop ski slope, hiking trails, café, and climbing wall enable year-round recreation  
- Transparent envelope reveals waste-to-energy process to public view  
- Building acts as landscape—permeable, active, multisensory  
- Rewilded paths with native grasses and biodiversity-supporting planting

---

### Ecological Function  
- Replaces landfill use with high-efficiency energy recovery  
- Significantly reduces carbon emissions from incineration through clean flue technology  
- Provides new green habitat in dense urban fabric  
- Helps normalize and visualize climate-scale material cycles

---

### Community Role  
- Skiers, hikers, tourists, and locals interact with the space daily  
- Schools and environmental groups use the site for learning and tours  
- The plant becomes a stage for civic spectacle and environmental education  
- Transforms “utility” into shared ritual

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Waste becomes visibility  
- Machinery becomes theater  
- The civic becomes joyful  
- CopenHill reflects a Danish ethos: transparency, humor, and ecological responsibility

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Landscape walkability on infrastructure reduces disconnection  
- Visual access to climate function decreases public anxiety  
- Movement and nature atop machines reframe the city as organism  
- Offers catharsis, curiosity, and ritual movement through ecological contradiction

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Powers and heats over 150,000 homes  
- International acclaim as model of eco-engineering and design narrative  
- Replicated as inspiration in public infrastructure globally  
- Repositions utility buildings as community touchpoints

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Function can become invitation  
- Infrastructure can support civic joy  
- Healing is not only personal—it can be structural, visible, collective
