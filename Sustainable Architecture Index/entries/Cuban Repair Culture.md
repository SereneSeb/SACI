summary: Informal spaces across Havana where citizens gather to repair appliances, tools, and vehicles—an architecture of care, ingenuity, and survival.
description: Emerging during Cuba’s Special Period, these sheds and garages function as lifelines of civic endurance. In the absence of formal markets or imports, Cubans built a decentralized infrastructure of repair—interweaving knowledge, scavenged parts, and public trust into resilient urban networks.
community_model: Volunteerism, barter, gifting, and informal labor define these spaces. Knowledge is passed intergenerationally—sometimes orally, sometimes through imitation. Repair sheds are often family-run or maintained by trusted neighborhood figures.

cultural_significance: Repair in Cuba is more than necessity—it is moral continuity. These spaces preserve autonomy, relational memory, and cultural identity through labor. Radios hum from the 1970s. Broken plastic chairs become wheel hubs. What should have expired becomes sacred through reinvention.
craftsmanship_materiality: Materials are second-hand, salvaged, hybridized. Techniques are intuitive, improvised, and iterative. Aesthetics yield to function—but hidden in each weld and wire splice is a story of ingenuity and care under constraint.
healing_design_principles: "These are spaces of dignity—not despair. In a context of scarcity, people find rhythm, mutual aid, and embodied problem-solving. Repair becomes ritual. Craft becomes continuity. Architecture becomes promise: that something broken can still be of use."

### Summary  
Informal spaces across Havana where citizens gather to repair appliances, tools, and vehicles—an architecture of care, ingenuity, and survival.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Built from necessity using scavenged materials and local ingenuity  
- Spaces range from shaded porches and alleyways to retrofitted garages  
- Flexibility and responsiveness prioritized over fixed forms  
- Typically open-air, walkable, and co-located with homes or shops  

---

### Ecological Function  
- Reduces need for new manufacturing and shipping  
- Extends life of goods beyond planned obsolescence  
- Minimizes landfill waste and system dependency  
- Regenerates informal economies and knowledge cycles

---

### Community Role  
- Anchors emotional and physical survival during collapse  
- Transfer of tools, skills, and stories sustains social fabric  
- Builds interdependence, trust, and local confidence  
- Offers presence and solidarity in a fragmented state system  

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Repair becomes political and spiritual—a refusal of abandonment  
- These spaces are civic altars to continuity, care, and adaptation  
- The built environment no longer reflects decay—but ingenuity  
- Culture is reasserted in wire splices, makeshift hinges, and salvaged motors

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Foster predictability, safety, and shared purpose  
- Reduce anxiety by preserving continuity in broken systems  
- Allow collective ritual through embodied problem-solving  
- Elevate craft, reuse, and intergenerational care as healing acts

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Strengthened neighborhood resilience and adaptation  
- Reinvigorated craft knowledge and intergenerational relationships  
- Prevented thousands of products from becoming waste  
- Framed new civic narratives of care in collapse

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Resilience grows where people are trusted to adapt  
- Repair is both ecological and emotional sustainability  
- Collapse is not an end—it's a condition for invention  
- Design need not be permanent to be sacred
