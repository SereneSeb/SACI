summary: Street-side pop-up clinics in Haiti responding to systemic collapse—built from salvaged materials and run by neighborhood coalitions and diaspora-supported volunteer networks.
description: Improvised yet essential, these clinics are made from tarps, scrap timber, and repurposed domestic objects. They appear on sidewalks, in alleys, or within church courtyards—offering vital triage and relational care. They reflect architecture as survival, solidarity, and public trust when state systems vanish.
community_model: Operated without permits by neighborhood groups, local nurses, and international volunteers. Often resourced through WhatsApp donations, remittances, and diaspora organizing. Governance is informal, but responsibility is collective and deeply rooted.
source_links: 
cultural_significance: These spaces are more than medical zones—they are civic rituals. They hold together the fragments of community in times of rupture. Care is not just administered—it is demonstrated. The clinics themselves are proof of cultural continuity through relational acts.
craftsmanship_materiality: Constructed from tarps, doors, broken signage, shipping pallets, and mosquito netting. Designed for rapid assembly, flexibility, and impermanence. Architecture as bricolage—responding to chaos with calm hands and patient improvisation.
healing_design_principles: Familiarity of faces, consistency of location, and the rhythm of return all help build emotional trust. These spaces carry dignity—through chairs, shade, presence. They offer relief not only from illness but from abandonment.

### Summary  
Street-side pop-up clinics in Haiti responding to systemic collapse—built from salvaged materials and run by neighborhood coalitions and diaspora-supported volunteer networks.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Constructed from necessity using scavenged materials and local ingenuity  
- Prioritizes mobility, shelter, and visibility  
- Low-tech and adaptable: folding tables become operating surfaces, tarps become roofs  
- Frequently relocated or rebuilt due to weather or conflict  

---

### Ecological Function  
- Minimal material and energy use through salvage and reuse  
- Avoids permanent ground disturbance  
- Situated in open-air environments to reduce infection spread  
- Sometimes integrated with edible or medicinal plantings  

---

### Community Role  
- Offer healthcare access where institutions no longer function  
- Strengthen networks of care, trust, and solidarity  
- Operate through local initiative, not external command  
- Train youth and distribute herbal, emotional, and first-aid knowledge  

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Represent resilience under abandonment  
- Embody shared refusal to disappear  
- Hold symbolic power as public spaces of touch, voice, and dignity  
- Sites where care becomes visibility, not secrecy  

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Emotional regulation through constancy, recognition, and communal space  
- Dignity restored through attention, listening, and small physical comforts  
- Healing enacted relationally: not just medical, but affective  
- The clinic as both wound and repair

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Saved lives with minimal infrastructure  
- Increased neighborhood autonomy and coordination  
- Reaffirmed culture of [[*konbit*]] (collective labor) and mutual aid  
- Emerged as spaces of civic leadership and adaptive hope  

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Architecture must be able to improvise when systems collapse  
- Healing requires presence, not perfection  
- The commons is not a building—it is a behavior  
- Urban resilience is held in hands, not permits
