summary: A porous ceramic-brick home that embodies climate adaptation, urban biophilia, and centuries-old Vietnamese craftsmanship.
description: Designed by Vo Trong Nghia Architects, the Bat Trang House is a luminous dialogue between modern architecture and ancestral materiality. Located in a dense district of Hanoi, it features a double-skin ceramic façade crafted by local artisans—regulating light, airflow, and privacy while reviving Vietnam’s ancient ceramic legacy.
community_model: The home was co-created with ceramic artisans from the Bat Trang village, employing traditional kilns and hand-forming techniques. The project sustains intergenerational craft knowledge while anchoring it in an urban architectural language.

cultural_significance: Bat Trang ceramics are central to Vietnamese material culture—used for vessels, shrines, and tiles for centuries. In this house, ceramics shift from artifact to architecture. Each brick carries the texture of place, labor, and elemental process (earth-fire-hand).
craftsmanship_materiality: The custom bricks are handmade from Bat Trang clay, each slightly varied and porous. The double façade weaves ornament with thermal function—diffusing sun, channeling breezes, and creating patterns of shadowplay across interior walls.
healing_design_principles: Filtered light and natural ventilation create a soft interior microclimate. Courtyards and staircases draw the eye upward, encouraging movement, reflection, and connection to sky. The porous skin quiets the dense urban soundscape, creating a refuge of breath and craft.

### Summary  
A porous ceramic-brick home that embodies climate adaptation, urban biophilia, and centuries-old Vietnamese craftsmanship.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Double-skin façade made of custom perforated ceramic blocks  
- Passive ventilation via courtyard and chimney effect  
- Diffused daylighting throughout, reducing glare and heat gain  
- Roof gardens and terraces promote evapotranspiration and plant integration  
- Structure integrates form, function, and storytelling through material

---

### Ecological Function  
- Passive cooling dramatically reduces energy use in hot tropical climate  
- Ceramic façade eliminates the need for artificial shading systems  
- Roof gardens provide biodiversity refuge and improve air quality  
- Clay bricks locally sourced, reducing transport emissions and supporting circular craft economies

---

### Community Role  
- Bricks hand-formed and kiln-fired by local artisans in Bat Trang village  
- Builds pride and continuity in a craft lineage over 700 years old  
- Serves as a public symbol of tradition adapted for the future

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Each brick is an index of hand, fire, and memory  
- The home becomes a vessel: holding climate, ritual, and relational textures  
- Material speaks the language of place—burnished clay, water-cut apertures, fire-toughened silence

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Ceramic façade softens light and encourages mindfulness  
- Open stairs and rooftop gardens restore sensory connection to nature  
- House functions as a breathable skin: porous, rhythmic, alive  
- Architecture becomes a refuge through slowness and touch

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Award-winning urban housing typology  
- Inspired a resurgence in ceramic-architecture integration across Asia  
- Strengthened Bat Trang village's reputation and economy through high-profile collaboration  
- Model for passive cooling and ornamental ecology in tropical cities

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Traditional crafts can re-enter the city not as nostalgia—but as infrastructure  
- Ornament and utility are not opposed—they can be one  
- Material culture is a technology of resilience
