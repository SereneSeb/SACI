summary: A multifunctional timber-framed hub in the heart of Meerstad—blending commerce, green space, and public life under a soaring wooden canopy.
description: Designed by De Zwarte Hond, SuperHub is a circular economy project rooted in timber structure, spatial openness, and adaptability. The building merges social programming, groceries, and leisure beneath a monumental yet warm volume—evoking civic presence and ecological intelligence.
community_model: Co-developed with municipal and resident input. Hosts everyday services and functions as a node of local life—gathering commerce, healthcare, and informal meeting under one structure.

cultural_significance: The design recalls cathedral-like gathering, but replaces spiritual grandeur with civic softness. Timber columns elevate everyday activities—affirming that sustainable design is not a luxury, but a living framework.
craftsmanship_materiality: Mass timber (glulam) columns and trusses form the superstructure. Façade glazing and wood composite panels allow daylight and material warmth to interact. Precision pre-fabrication allowed for fast, low-waste assembly.
healing_design_principles: The space is open, sunlit, and rhythmic. Natural light, wooden surfaces, and green thresholds soften urban life and invite multisensory calm. Architecture becomes a breath—a daily rhythm of arrival, pause, and exchange.

### Summary  
A multifunctional timber-framed hub in the heart of Meerstad—blending commerce, green space, and public life under a soaring wooden canopy.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Engineered mass timber structure for embodied carbon reduction  
- Large open-span with natural daylight and modular infill flexibility  
- Façade transparency enhances orientation and passive light use  
- Designed for potential future repurposing, disassembly, and low-maintenance longevity

---

### Ecological Function  
- Timber construction significantly lowers embodied emissions  
- Integrated solar gain and passive climate response  
- Green infrastructure surrounds support pollination and rainwater filtration  
- Anticipates circular reuse through dismountable joinery and adaptable interior

---

### Community Role  
- Central gathering space for Meerstad residents  
- Combines pharmacy, supermarket, café, social health point, and informal events  
- Hosts neighborhood programs and becomes a civic landmark for the growing suburb  
- Soft thresholds encourage intergenerational use and unstructured gathering

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Timber arches reference ancient gathering halls and communal hearths  
- A new typology of retail-as-commons: restorative, not extractive  
- Everyday life elevated through architectural generosity  
- Symbol of ecological pride and circular innovation

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Natural daylight reduces fatigue, improves circadian rhythm  
- Warm wood acoustics and textures invite psychological softness  
- Open volume reduces spatial stress and fosters inclusive orientation  
- Places commerce in dialogue with care, nature, and neighborhood

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Winner of the International Architecture Award 2023  
- Recognized for timber innovation and civic programming  
- Strengthens community identity in a newly urbanizing suburb  
- Provides replicable model for timber urbanism at neighborhood scale

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Public infrastructure can be regenerative and beautiful  
- Mass timber enables structural clarity, speed, and low-carbon future  
- Commerce and care can co-exist in spatially sensitive design  
- Buildings must anticipate change—not resist it
