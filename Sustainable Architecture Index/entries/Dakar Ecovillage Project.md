summary: A grassroots project on the urban fringe of Dakar that restores ecological housing, food systems, and cultural memory through vernacular design, permaculture, and neighborhood collaboration.
description: This ecovillage initiative blends dry sanitation systems, passive earth housing, and permaculture with community-led development on the margins of Senegal’s capital. It revives ancestral knowledge while preparing for an uncertain ecological future—building with what’s at hand, but toward something enduring.
community_model: Participatory planning drives every layer of the project—from home design to garden layout to water reuse. Youth apprenticeships, women’s cooperatives, and traditional elders all co-develop this shared vision.

cultural_significance: In a context of rapid displacement and environmental stress, the project reclaims West African earthcraft, food rituals, and collective care. It grounds urban expansion in continuity rather than rupture—where every toilet, brick, and garden becomes an act of cultural return.
craftsmanship_materiality: The homes are built from earthbrick—formed, dried, and assembled by local hands. Composting toilets, edible gardens, and rain tanks are crafted through on-site learning circles, blending tactile skill with ecological reciprocity.
healing_design_principles: Design supports dignity, sovereignty, and repair. Shade, airflow, fertile soil, and cultural rhythm combine to create spaces that heal—where a village becomes its own infrastructure of care.

### Summary  
A grassroots project on the urban fringe of Dakar that restores ecological housing, food systems, and cultural memory through vernacular design, permaculture, and neighborhood collaboration.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Earthbrick housing oriented for passive cooling and seasonal winds  
- Dry toilets with urine separation and compost cycles  
- Interplanted gardens with indigenous and adapted crops  
- Greywater reuse and rain harvesting systems  
- Neighborhood design charrettes involving all resident groups

---

### Ecological Function  
- Closed-loop sanitation builds soil rather than pollutes  
- Water use drastically reduced through harvesting and reuse  
- Gardens support food security and carbon sequestration  
- Reduces dependency on unreliable state services and imported goods

---

### Community Role  
- Residents trained in ecological construction and permaculture  
- Elders guide vernacular revival while youth lead innovations  
- Women’s groups manage sanitation and community kitchen cycles  
- Project acts as node of learning for visiting villages and NGOs

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Reclaims soil not only as building material—but as ancestral continuity  
- Restores “village within the city” as a rhythm of life, not nostalgia  
- Design embodies Senegalese values: mutual aid, rhythm, rootedness  
- Architecture is not an object—but a cultural vessel in use

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Embodied labor reconnects people to earth, place, and cycle  
- Compost becomes a metaphor of return and regeneration  
- Shade trees, courtyard flows, and food harvests provide quiet rituals of repair  
- Homes feel alive, adaptable, and dignified—built with care, not extraction

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Dozens of homes built with local materials and knowledge  
- Full neighborhood-scale compost and food system in place  
- Inspiration for similar projects in The Gambia, Mali, and Burkina Faso  
- Reinforced ecological autonomy and community pride

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Ecological sovereignty begins with cultural memory  
- Dry sanitation and permaculture are viable urban infrastructures  
- Local knowledge systems can outpace imported design logics  
- Beauty, utility, and resilience can emerge together—from the soil
