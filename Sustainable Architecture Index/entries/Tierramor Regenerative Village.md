summary: A regenerative living project in Costa Rica integrating agroforestry, spiritual ecology, and education—Tierramor weaves design, ritual, and ecology into a bioregional architecture of renewal.
description: Tierramor is a regenerative learning village in Costa Rica, combining ecological restoration, spiritual intentionality, and cooperative governance. It integrates agroecology, community-building, and sacred design practices to create a living system rooted in the rhythms of land, cosmos, and community.
community_model: Land-based intentional community practicing shared stewardship, co-governance, and regenerative education. Apprenticeship programs blend daily labor, ritual, and systems thinking within a collective social fabric.

cultural_significance: Rooted in Central American cosmologies of reciprocity and ritual care, Tierramor reclaims the village as sacred ecology—where food, spirit, and story grow together.
craftsmanship_materiality: Buildings constructed with adobe, clay, bamboo, and regional timber. Techniques are collaborative and site-responsive, reflecting the knowledge of both indigenous vernacular and global regenerative design wisdom.
healing_design_principles: Spaces are shaped for sensory attunement and nervous system recalibration—through natural textures, sacred geometry, open thresholds, and cyclical rituals. Healing arises from daily rhythm, spatial clarity, and relationship to earth.
era: Regenerative Community Wave (2020s–present)
bioregion: Central Mexico Highlands
crisis_context: Ecological Crisis & Rural Re-rooting
historical_precedent: Mesoamerican Agricultural Settlements & Permaculture Systems

### Summary  
A regenerative living project in Costa Rica integrating agroforestry, spiritual ecology, and education—Tierramor weaves design, ritual, and ecology into a bioregional architecture of renewal.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Integrated agroforestry and food forests  
- Bioclimatic and earth-based architecture  
- Water retention landscaping and seasonal flow design  
- Shared ritual spaces: community temples, kitchens, learning hubs  
- Infrastructure as social technology: designed for care and participation

---

### Ecological Function  
- Restores degraded cattle pasture into forest-agriculture mosaic  
- Enhances biodiversity, pollinator corridors, and watershed cycles  
- Closed-loop waste, composting, and nutrient systems  
- Cultivates food, fiber, medicine, and habitat in holistic polycultures

---

### Community Role  
- Stewards land cooperatively through residency and apprenticeship  
- Offers public education in regenerative systems, governance, and embodiment  
- Uses ritual councils and seasonal ceremonies to organize social coherence  
- Models a village-scale response to ecological grief and planetary collapse

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Architecture expresses the story of regeneration—built from reverence  
- Temples, fire circles, and orchards operate as spiritual infrastructure  
- Planning follows lunar, seasonal, and biotic rhythms  
- Invokes land not as resource, but as kin

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Materials breathe, floors ground, walls curve—regulating emotion  
- Spaces hold silence, laughter, sweat, and rest as shared rituals  
- Water and fire are elemental presences throughout the village  
- Architecture returns the body to slowness, gratitude, and collective presence

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Transformed degraded land into a thriving, closed-loop system  
- Educated hundreds of apprentices from around the world  
- Influenced other regenerative villages in Latin America  
- Became a case study in biocultural restoration

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- True sustainability begins with cultural transformation  
- Ritual and governance are spatial technologies  
- Design must adapt to biome, story, and soul  
- Living systems thrive through pattern, not control
