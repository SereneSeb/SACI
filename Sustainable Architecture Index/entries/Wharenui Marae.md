summary: The wharenui is a Māori communal house and spiritual vessel, embodying ancestral presence, kinship, and ritual care. It is both building and body, where architecture holds cosmology.
description: Wharenui are carved timber buildings that serve as central gathering spaces on marae (tribal meeting grounds). Every element is symbolic—rafters as ribs, ridgebeam as spine, carvings as ancestors. The space hosts funerals, ceremonies, sleep, conflict resolution, and story. It is architecture as embodiment, education, and healing.
community_model: Owned by iwi (tribes) or hapū (subtribes), governed through tikanga (customary law), and activated through pōwhiri (welcome ceremonies), tangihanga (funerals), and hui (gatherings). Community stewardship and intergenerational presence define its logic.

cultural_significance: The wharenui holds whakapapa (genealogy), atua (deities), and memory. It is carved time—where ancestors speak and the living listen. Through its form, the marae is not past—it is continuous presence.
craftsmanship_materiality: Constructed with local timber such as totara or kauri, carved by tohunga whakairo (master carvers). Interior adorned with woven tukutuku panels and painted kōwhaiwhai patterns, expressing ancestral stories and tribal cosmologies through handwork and sacred lineage.
healing_design_principles: By sleeping, speaking, and grieving beneath the ancestor's ribs, emotional restoration becomes collective. Architecture here does not isolate—it binds. The wharenui holds space for rupture, transformation, and return.

### Summary  
The wharenui is a Māori communal house and spiritual vessel, embodying ancestral presence, kinship, and ritual care. It is both building and body, where architecture holds cosmology.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Longhouse form symbolizing human anatomy  
- Carvings, woven panels, and spatial rituals encode cosmology  
- Axial alignment with sacred landmarks or mountains  
- Threshold ceremony (pōwhiri) initiates energetic and social shift

---

### Ecological Function  
- Built with native and renewable materials (timber, flax, raupo)  
- Ventilation and thermal performance based on seasonal wind and sun  
- Grounds support biodiversity, food sharing, and ritual planting  
- Circular use of space—ceremony and sleep within the same structure

---

### Community Role  
- Activated daily and seasonally through protocols and ritual  
- Youth learn genealogy, story, and law through embodiment  
- Inter-iwi gatherings, weddings, tangihanga, and conflict resolution  
- Space of justice, mourning, kinship, and renewal

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- The wharenui is a living ancestor—walked into, spoken to, wept within  
- Ritual breath (karanga, haka, waiata) activates space  
- Architecture becomes a medium of ancestral transmission  
- Everything seen is also remembered

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Collective sleep and ceremony regulate grief and trauma  
- Space provides deep familiarity and ontological security  
- Elders, children, and the dead all held under one roof  
- Design creates psychological permission to feel, share, and remember

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Maintains Māori language, law, and social cohesion  
- Resists colonial spatial logics and epistemicide  
- Models ancestral urbanism and indigenous planning frameworks  
- Serves as blueprint for cultural resurgence

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Architecture must not erase history—it must carry it  
- Ritual is spatial technology  
- Collective memory requires collective space  
- Healing can be held through form, symbol, and breath
