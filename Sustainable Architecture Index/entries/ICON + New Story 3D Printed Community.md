summary: The ICON + New Story community in Tabasco, Mexico is the world’s first neighborhood of 3D printed homes designed for families experiencing extreme poverty and climate vulnerability.
description: Developed by ICON (USA) and New Story (non-profit), this community features 50 3D printed homes built using the Vulcan printer and Lavacrete, a proprietary low-carbon material. The project combines technological innovation with deep social intent—offering durable, dignified housing with high thermal performance in a region prone to flooding and instability.
community_model: Residents were selected through a participatory process and live in permanent, single-family homes with infrastructure such as electricity and running water. The initiative integrates social equity, local labor, and design adaptation to community needs.

cultural_significance: This project shifts the conversation on 3D printing from experimental tech to **dignified, equitable housing**. It demonstrates how advanced tools can be used to build stability, not spectacle.
craftsmanship_materiality: Homes are printed using Lavacrete, a high-performance material developed for speed, durability, and insulation. Each unit is built in 24 hours, with additional manual labor for fittings and finishes, allowing a fusion of high-tech process and community craftsmanship.
healing_design_principles: Solid walls, climate-adapted form, and family-oriented layout foster physical and emotional safety. The rapid construction reduces precarity, while community integration supports mutual aid and recovery.

### Summary  
The ICON + New Story community in Tabasco, Mexico is the world’s first neighborhood of 3D printed homes designed for families experiencing extreme poverty and climate vulnerability.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Rapid construction using 3D printed Lavacrete walls  
- Simple, durable designs for thermal comfort and flood resilience  
- Each unit includes kitchen, bathroom, and living space  
- Layout informed by participatory design process

---

### Ecological Function  
- Reduced construction waste through additive manufacturing  
- Lavacrete designed for strength, insulation, and low-carbon performance  
- Eliminates need for timber or steel framing  
- Builds climate resilience in flood-prone zones

---

### Community Role  
- Residents involved in planning and layout  
- Targeted toward families in precarious living conditions  
- Homes offered as long-term, stable infrastructure  
- Encourages ownership, stability, and inter-household support

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Proves that advanced technology can serve justice, not luxury  
- Homes symbolize a shift from dependency to empowerment  
- Embodies architectural care in a post-crisis world  
- Bridges innovation with basic human dignity

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Durable, secure housing supports trauma recovery  
- Indoor climate stability aids health and comfort  
- Family-focused layout supports relational stability  
- Construction process restores dignity through speed and permanence

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- 50+ families housed in the first full-scale printed neighborhood  
- Model replicated in other climate-vulnerable regions  
- Elevated discourse on social impact of 3D printing  
- Reframed housing innovation around equity and community

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Speed can support care and quality  
- Emerging tech can empower, not alienate  
- Participatory design strengthens technological adoption  
- Scalable systems can work for the most vulnerable
