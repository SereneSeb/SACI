summary: TOVA is a 3D printed earth-based prototype developed to explore climate-adaptive, affordable housing for rural and semi-arid environments.
description: Created through a collaboration between the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) and WASP, the TOVA Prototype uses local soil and natural binders to form a structurally stable, breathable dwelling. Its dome shape optimizes thermal comfort, and it can be built entirely off-grid using solar energy and WASP’s modular printing system. TOVA demonstrates the feasibility of hyper-local, low-tech digital housing.
community_model: Though a prototype, TOVA is intended for decentralized reproduction in resource-scarce regions. Its approach aligns with smallholder farming communities, refugee camps, or remote settlements seeking autonomy and ecological coherence.

cultural_significance: TOVA reinterprets vernacular earth architecture through open-source fabrication. It symbolizes a return to **local rhythms** and community-led production while embracing future-forward technologies.
craftsmanship_materiality: Built from local clay and fibers using a WASP printer and solar-powered battery packs. Minimal infrastructure and zero concrete involved. The curved, continuous walls combine digital form-finding with earth’s expressive, textured tactility.
healing_design_principles: "Its circular plan, earthen walls, and breathable enclosure support **calm and environmental intimacy**. TOVA embodies a grounded ethic: slow, soft, and situated."

### Summary  
TOVA is a 3D printed earth-based prototype developed to explore climate-adaptive, affordable housing for rural and semi-arid environments.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Single-room dome form for climate responsiveness  
- Printed on-site using local materials  
- No foundation, steel, or synthetic insulation required  
- Renewable energy powers the fabrication process

---

### Ecological Function  
- Minimizes transportation and embodied energy  
- Breathable walls regulate temperature and humidity  
- Fully compostable or recyclable into soil  
- Design aligns with semi-arid, low-resource conditions

---

### Community Role  
- Supports autonomous, off-grid habitation  
- Adaptable to informal and low-infrastructure contexts  
- Offers dignity in places often served by tents or concrete blocks  
- Empowers local construction with minimal tooling

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Revives earth-dome vernaculars through modern tools  
- Architecture as a seed—adaptive, regenerative, rooted  
- Repositions building as a civic and ecological act  
- Celebrates the tactile continuity of soil and shelter

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Enclosure promotes sensory grounding and thermal comfort  
- Off-grid autonomy reduces precarity and stress  
- Curved space promotes a calming spatial experience  
- Aligns the inhabitant with the pace of the environment

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- First 3D printed earthen structure in Spain  
- Validated WASP and IAAC’s low-tech digital fabrication pipeline  
- Inspired use of renewable energy in on-site 3D construction  
- Promoted earth-printing as a viable post-collapse solution

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Earth-based 3D printing can be localized and ethical  
- Printing infrastructure can be portable and renewable  
- Low-tech methods scale better in low-infrastructure areas  
- Design is a translation of place, not a projection onto it
