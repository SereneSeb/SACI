summary: Vauban is a cooperative, eco-urban district in Freiburg designed with citizen participation, energy-positive buildings, and car-free public space.

cultural_significance: A modern symbol of participatory urbanism and European ecological consciousness. Its layout resists capitalist individualism in favor of collective welfare and spatial trust.
craftsmanship_materiality: Precision-engineered passive and plus-energy buildings using local and modular materials. Streetscapes feature permeable surfaces, green thresholds, and civic tactility—designed not for cars, but for feet and conversation.
healing_design_principles: Neighborhood design encourages slow movement, communal interaction, and psychological well-being through clarity, walkability, and rhythmic public life. Streets double as playgrounds and meeting grounds.

### Summary  
Vauban is a cooperative, eco-urban district in Freiburg designed with citizen participation, energy-positive buildings, and car-free public space.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Passive house and plus-energy housing throughout  
- Dense, low-rise housing with pedestrian-first streets  
- Integrated tram network and cycling infrastructure  
- Community gardens, schools, and shared cultural venues  
- Cooperative development over speculative markets

---

### Ecological Function  
- Drastic reduction in transport-related emissions  
- Energy-positive homes contribute to grid decentralization  
- Stormwater absorbed via green corridors and permeable paths  
- High biodiversity index through pollinator-friendly landscaping and tree coverage

---

### Community Role  
- Driven by Forum Vauban (citizen planning group)  
- Most housing built by co-housing cooperatives  
- Public spaces managed collectively through resident initiatives  
- Supports intergenerational care, refugee inclusion, and multigenerational governance

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- A living challenge to consumerist and car-dominated city forms  
- Urban space becomes a medium of social learning and cooperation  
- Infrastructure framed as a commons—not a commodity  
- Reclaims the street as space for life, not traffic

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Public realms foster spontaneous interaction and mutual care  
- Absence of cars lowers noise, risk, and anxiety for all ages  
- Design scales respond to human rhythm—no visual or spatial aggression  
- Green spaces buffer stress and offer multisensory recalibration

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Residents use ~50% less energy than national average  
- Over 70% of housing developed cooperatively  
- Car ownership well below average (under 20%)  
- Studied globally as a template for sustainable district planning

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Urban resilience grows from civic trust and ecological intention  
- Co-governance can deliver deep sustainability  
- Planning must center people, not profit  
- Cities are bodies of care—or not at all
