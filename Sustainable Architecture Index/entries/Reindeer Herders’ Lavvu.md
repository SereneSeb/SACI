summary: The lavvu is a portable shelter used by Sámi reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia, designed for cold-climate nomadism, spiritual coherence, and ecological sensitivity.
description: The lavvu—also spelled lávvu or lavvo—is a traditional tent-like structure used by the Indigenous Sámi people. It resembles a conical tipi but is lower in profile and more stable in Arctic wind conditions. Constructed from wooden poles and covered with fabric or hides, the lavvu is the spatial and cultural anchor of Sámi nomadic life, migrating with reindeer herds and serving as a site for rest, ritual, and repair.
community_model: Lavvus are set up in seasonal camps following the movement of reindeer across tundra landscapes. Families travel together in kinship groups, sharing labor, fire, and caretaking. While modern materials like canvas have replaced hides, the spatial rhythms and cultural protocols endure.

cultural_significance: The lavvu holds the continuity of Sámi cosmology and political identity. Its structure and form encode knowledge about orientation, weather, storytelling, and Indigenous sovereignty. It is a refusal of imposed settlement and a celebration of lifeways rooted in kinship with reindeer and landscape.
craftsmanship_materiality: Lavvus are constructed using long, straight poles made from spruce or birch, arranged in a tripod base with additional supports. Covers may include reindeer hides, canvas, or wool blankets. Assembly is collective, with knowledge passed orally and experientially.
healing_design_principles: Within the lavvu, warmth, smoke, and quiet define the atmosphere. The structure reconnects the individual to movement, land, and story. Its spatial humility allows grief, song, repair, and return to fold into daily life.

### Summary  
The lavvu is a portable shelter used by Sámi reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia, designed for cold-climate nomadism, spiritual coherence, and ecological sensitivity.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Low-profile conical structure for wind deflection  
- Tripod base with layered pole supports  
- Central hearth with smoke vent  
- Easily packed and reassembled in new locations

---

### Ecological Function  
- Uses locally sourced wood and hides or canvas  
- No permanent footprint or foundation  
- Supports migratory herd cycles and ecological regeneration  
- Breathable, insulating, and wind-resistant

---

### Community Role  
- Site of family cohesion, oral tradition, and subsistence ritual  
- Shared between generations for education and healing  
- Forms temporary villages during seasonal herding  
- Anchors Sámi land claims and cultural expression

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Sacred geometry of tripod and fire  
- Emblem of Sámi identity and resistance to assimilation  
- Spiritual enclosure and narrative space  
- Shelter that moves in rhythm with kin, land, and animal

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Fire warmth and sound buffering support emotional safety  
- Low enclosure invites grounding and embodiment  
- Shared care for space reinforces interdependence  
- Architecture dissolves into migration, offering continuity through motion

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- Lavvu remains in active use across Sápmi  
- Symbol of Sámi resurgence and land sovereignty  
- Adapted for education, activism, and cultural diplomacy  
- Studied as an exemplar of Indigenous climate design

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Movement is a knowledge system  
- Architecture can be resistance and refuge  
- Temporary shelters hold durable meaning  
- Landscape and shelter can co-write identity
