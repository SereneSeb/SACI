summary: Lammas is the UK’s first authorized low-impact ecovillage, established under the One Planet Development policy. Residents live in self-built natural homes, practice permaculture, and govern land as a living commons.
description: Founded in 2009, Lammas represents a convergence of ecological vision, craftsmanship, and legal innovation. The village comprises roundhouses, straw bale homes, and timber shelters—each designed for energy independence, ecological repair, and seasonal attunement. Living rhythms emerge from shared labor, land-based income, and ritual care.
community_model: Structured as a legal cooperative, decision-making is consensus-based and enacted through land working groups. Residents collectively manage forest gardens, shared infrastructure, and outreach education. Each household maintains an annual ecological audit under One Planet criteria.

cultural_significance: Lammas is a living precedent—proof that post-carbon, bioregional settlement is both lawful and joyful. It transforms rural resistance into architecture. Every structure, compost system, and footpath enacts a cultural logic of sufficiency, reciprocity, and renewal.
craftsmanship_materiality: Homes are built from roundwood, thatch, turf, cob, lime, and straw—locally harvested and shaped by hand. Craft here is not aesthetic—it is survival with dignity. Each wall and roof is calibrated to place, and built by the people who live within them.
healing_design_principles: Architecture is slow, layered, and alive. Spaces respond to weather, sun, and the movement of animals. Design supports mental health through land intimacy, bodily labor, and visual quiet. This is housing as embodied resilience.

### Summary  
Lammas is the UK’s first authorized low-impact ecovillage, established under the One Planet Development policy. Residents live in self-built natural homes, practice permaculture, and govern land as a living commons.

---

### Design Strategy  
- Natural buildings designed and constructed by residents  
- Use of local timber, straw, turf, clay, and recycled materials  
- Passive solar orientation, compost toilets, rainwater harvesting  
- Each home integrates food-growing, energy generation, and water cycling

---

### Ecological Function  
- Energy self-sufficient through solar and micro-hydro systems  
- Permaculture zones and food forests support biodiversity  
- Dry sanitation, reed beds, and greywater reuse systems  
- Minimal external input and near-zero carbon footprint

---

### Community Role  
- Residents form a cooperative and uphold shared land governance  
- Decision-making is horizontal, iterative, and transparent  
- Visitors, apprenticeships, and public events expand educational impact  
- Income tied to land-based productivity, not speculation

---

### Cultural / Symbolic Layer  
- Proves low-impact living is politically and spatially viable in the UK  
- Each building is a declaration of place-based autonomy  
- Rituals of construction, composting, and harvest re-anchor meaning  
- The village is not utopia—it is a site of practiced possibility

---

### Healing Design Principles  
- Rhythms tied to seasonal cycles and sensory connection  
- Home becomes site of purpose, not escape—emotional repair through work  
- Tactile, unfinished materials promote psychological grounding  
- Shared space reduces isolation and reweaves community bonds

---

### Outcomes & Impact  
- First planning consent granted under radical ecological development policy  
- Catalyzed national conversation on rural land use and sustainable planning  
- Provided case study for regenerative settlement frameworks in the UK  
- Continues to inspire low-impact development around the world

---

### Lessons & Transferability  
- Radical change can occur within existing legal frameworks  
- Low-tech, high-touch housing can be dignified, durable, and joyful  
- Healing is social, spatial, and ecological—and begins where we dwell  
- Architecture becomes a negotiation between sufficiency and reverence
