# Modular Frames with Rubble Infill (Wood/Steel/Bamboo)

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation outlines the construction and testing of modular frame wall systems filled with rubble for sustainable, low-cost housing. The method uses locally sourced timber, steel, or bamboo frames filled with rubble or debris to provide structural and thermal mass. It offers a flexible, replicable approach suitable for rebuilding in post-conflict or disaster-affected communities where conventional materials are limited.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-23  
- **Location:** Al-Zahra Workshop District, Central Gaza  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Mediterranean semi-arid, moderate humidity with seasonal heat variation

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Construction Coordinator – oversees design layout and load-path planning  
- Carpentry/Metalwork Crew – fabricates frame units on-site  
- Infill Team – prepares rubble, fills panels, and installs mesh or lath  
- Safety Supervisor – ensures compliance with structural and PPE standards

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Cutting tools (saws, grinders), welding equipment for steel frames, nails, wire mesh or woven bamboo lath, hammers, measuring tapes, PPE (gloves, masks, boots), and plastering tools.

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
1. **Frame Fabrication:** Timber, steel, or bamboo cut to standard module size (typically 90×210 cm).  
2. **Panel Assembly:** Frames assembled and reinforced with diagonal bracing.  
3. **Infill Placement:** Rubble placed within panels, compacted manually; mesh or lath attached on both sides.  
4. **Stacking & Installation:** Panels fixed together using bolts or wire ties, forming wall grids.  
5. **Finishing:** Plaster applied to internal/external faces; optional lime coating for weatherproofing.  
6. **Inspection:** Alignment, connection integrity, and plaster adhesion verified prior to deployment.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
The modular frame method proved adaptable across multiple materials, with bamboo offering the best thermal and weight balance, and steel providing the greatest durability. Daily output averaged six panels with a six-person crew. The rubble infill improved wall stiffness and provided excellent sound insulation. Challenges included frame alignment on uneven foundations and ensuring adequate compaction in upper panel sections.

### Safety & Ethics
- Mandatory PPE use for all operations, especially during cutting and welding  
- Segregation of work zones to prevent injury from falling debris  
- Ethical sourcing of bamboo and timber verified to prevent ecological harm  
- Inclusive training sessions to promote local employment and skills transfer

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** Low energy demand; combination of manual labour and minimal electrical tools.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Maximises reuse of rubble while reducing need for high-carbon materials such as cement. The modular format simplifies maintenance and replacement.  
- **Local Adaptation:** Adapted to available materials — steel from scrap yards, bamboo from nearby agricultural zones, and salvaged wood from destroyed housing units.

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Field load tests confirmed panels’ lateral stability and compressive performance up to 1.5 tonnes per unit. Visual inspections confirmed frame plumbness and panel cohesion.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The modular frame with rubble infill technique presents a promising hybrid for sustainable reconstruction, offering strong adaptability and resource efficiency. Future work should focus on standardising panel sizes, testing composite bamboo-steel hybrids for seismic resilience, and developing detailed manuals to train community builders.
