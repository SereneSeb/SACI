# Gabion / Mesh 'Basket' Rubble Walls

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation documents the use of gabion or mesh “basket” rubble walls for rapid, low-cement construction in post-conflict or flood-prone areas. The method employs wire cages filled with rubble to create strong, permeable, and flexible wall systems suitable for retaining structures, erosion control, and core housing units.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-21  
- **Location:** Beit Hanoun Perimeter Zone, Northern Gaza  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Semi-arid coastal environment, subject to flash flooding and high wind exposure

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Structural Supervisor – oversees cage layout and alignment  
- Wire Technician – cuts and ties mesh panels  
- Filling Crew – collects, sorts, and packs rubble into baskets  
- Quality Checker – verifies stability, compaction, and jointing integrity

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Galvanised steel wire mesh rolls, wire cutters, tie wire, pliers, spacers, hammers, and basic PPE (gloves, boots, helmets). Optional small hoist or pulley system for moving filled cages.

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
1. **Site Preparation:** Foundation trenches excavated and levelled.  
2. **Cage Assembly:** Mesh panels cut and tied into baskets, reinforced with spacers for rigidity.  
3. **Filling:** Rubble manually placed and compacted in layers to minimise voids.  
4. **Stacking:** Cages aligned and tied together in a staggered pattern for wall stability.  
5. **Finishing:** External surfaces optionally plastered or covered with geotextile for weather resistance.  
6. **Inspection:** Wall checked for vertical alignment, tie integrity, and base settlement before approval.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
Construction progressed efficiently with a team of eight workers achieving approximately 6 linear metres of wall per day. The rubble’s irregular shape improved interlock within the mesh, reducing settlement risk. Galvanised mesh showed minor corrosion in saline conditions but maintained structural integrity over time. The system performed well in absorbing lateral earth pressures and provided a visually acceptable surface when plastered.

### Safety & Ethics
- Strict glove use to prevent cuts from wire edges  
- Clear segregation of work and pedestrian areas  
- Prohibition on reusing corroded or broken wire mesh  
- Fair labour distribution and adherence to cooperative wage standards

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** Fully manual process requiring no heavy machinery.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Utilises on-site rubble, drastically reducing material imports and carbon emissions. Offers adaptable solutions for both structural and landscape applications.  
- **Local Adaptation:** Mesh gauge and cage size adjusted for locally available rubble. Training provided for community labour to replicate construction at residential scale.

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Sample wall sections tested for lateral load and pull-out strength. Visual inspection conducted after curing period to confirm structural performance.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The gabion rubble wall method demonstrated high resilience and adaptability for low-resource environments. Future trials should explore the integration of bamboo or basalt fibre mesh as corrosion-resistant alternatives. Establishing community workshops to fabricate standard gabion modules could enhance scalability and employment.
