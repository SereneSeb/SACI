# Manual Rebar Salvage & Straightening

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation focuses on salvaging reinforcing steel bars (rebar) from demolished structures in a post-conflict urban setting. The goal is to recover, clean, and manually straighten rebar for reuse in non-critical construction components, reducing the need for imported materials and supporting circular recovery within the built environment.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-17  
- **Location:** Western Industrial District, Gaza City  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Coastal Mediterranean, hot and dry with moderate humidity

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Site Supervisor – oversees workflow and safety compliance  
- Metal Specialist – leads rebar extraction and cutting  
- Manual Labour Crew – 5–6 local workers responsible for recovery and cleaning  
- Quality Controller – inspects and grades salvaged materials

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Protective gloves, goggles, crowbars, hammers, hacksaws, manual bending/straightening jigs, hand torches (for cutting where safe), and scales for weighing recovered material.

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
Work areas were divided into quadrants, prioritised based on visible steel exposure. Teams extracted rebar using hand tools, avoiding thermal cutting in structurally unstable zones. Straightening was performed using jig stations constructed from local materials. A mobile log was maintained to track recovered quantities, corrosion levels, and grade classifications.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
Recovered rebar varied in diameter (8–20 mm) and condition, with corrosion found on roughly 35% of samples. Manual straightening proved efficient for smaller diameters but required multiple passes for thick bars. The team developed an effective rhythm, averaging 100 kg of straightened steel per day. Thermal damage was rare but evident on pieces from burnt concrete zones.

### Safety & Ethics
- Continuous PPE use and scheduled rest due to high ambient temperatures  
- Strict exclusion of children or untrained persons from work zones  
- Separation and tagging of suspect materials (potential UXO contamination)  
- Adherence to “Do No Harm” principles in debris handling and community relations

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** Entirely manual energy input with limited tool use; no powered machinery required.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Operation contributes to local circular economy by reintroducing salvaged steel into the construction loop and reducing import dependency.  
- **Local Adaptation:** Straightening jigs and cutting tools fabricated locally from scrap, ensuring low-cost replicability and easy repair.

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Simple bend and tensile tests performed on representative samples to ensure ductility and structural integrity; failed samples discarded or reclassified for non-structural use.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The manual salvage approach proved labour-intensive but cost-effective, particularly for rebuilding small community facilities. Future iterations should explore improved leverage tools and community training workshops. A cooperative ownership model for rebar processing equipment could enhance long-term resilience and equitable material access.
