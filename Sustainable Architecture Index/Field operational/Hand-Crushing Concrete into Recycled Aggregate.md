# Hand-Crushing Concrete into Recycled Aggregate

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation documents low-tech methods for hand-crushing and grading concrete rubble into usable recycled aggregate. The goal is to create a local supply of coarse and fine aggregates suitable for non-structural concrete, paving, and sub-base layers, using minimal energy and accessible tools in post-conflict or resource-scarce settings.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-18  
- **Location:** Central Repair Yard, Khan Younis, Gaza Strip  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Semi-arid coastal plain, high dust exposure, limited machinery availability

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Site Lead – directs crushing sequence and safety supervision  
- Sorting Crew – 6–8 local workers responsible for sorting, crushing, and sieving  
- Quality Controller – monitors gradation, contamination, and moisture levels  
- Logistics Assistant – manages material flow and bagging

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Sledgehammers, shovels, sieves (10mm and 5mm mesh), protective gloves, dust masks, wheelbarrows, and collection bins. Optional small-scale mechanical crusher used for initial breaking of oversized rubble when available.

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
Crushing was organised in three stages:  
1. **Primary breakage** — large rubble broken into manageable fragments.  
2. **Secondary crushing** — fragments reduced to coarse aggregate size (~10–20mm).  
3. **Screening & sieving** — fine and coarse fractions separated and bagged.  
Periodic spraying used to control dust. Manual logs kept for weight, labour hours, and output ratios.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
Material quality was generally high, with 80% of recovered concrete suitable for reuse. Manual crushing achieved an output rate of approximately 0.8 tonnes/day with eight workers. Dust levels were significant but manageable with masks and spray control. Fine aggregates showed slightly higher contamination rates due to soil mixing near collection sites. Consistent manual effort produced a stable grading curve suitable for lean concrete and paving.

### Safety & Ethics
- Mandatory PPE for all participants  
- Rotational work schedule to avoid fatigue and repetitive strain injuries  
- Controlled water misting to suppress dust and maintain respiratory safety  
- Clear separation of working and residential zones to minimise community exposure

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** Fully manual energy input, occasional use of low-power crusher.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Reduces need for imported sand and gravel, supports circular economy, and lowers carbon emissions from material transport.  
- **Local Adaptation:** Operation adapted for small yards, using modular teams and simple equipment for replication in different municipalities.

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Trial mixes conducted using recycled aggregate showed acceptable strength for non-structural use; periodic sieve analyses confirmed grading compliance.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The operation demonstrated the viability of fully manual aggregate production in low-resource environments. Next steps include developing improved dust control measures, documenting mix ratios for standardised non-structural applications, and coordinating with local authorities to incorporate manual aggregate supply chains into reconstruction planning.
