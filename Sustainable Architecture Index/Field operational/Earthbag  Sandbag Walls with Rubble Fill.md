# Earthbag / Sandbag Walls with Rubble Fill

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation details the construction of earthbag or sandbag walls using locally sourced rubble and soil mixtures. The technique is a low-cost, high-mass walling method that provides thermal stability, ballistic resistance, and rapid assembly. It is particularly suited to temporary or semi-permanent shelters in post-conflict, disaster, or flood-prone environments.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-22  
- **Location:** Southern Gaza Reconstruction Zone  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Coastal semi-arid region with variable humidity and saline wind exposure

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Construction Supervisor – oversees wall geometry and safety procedures  
- Bag Filling Crew – fills and compacts rubble-soil mixture  
- Layout Crew – aligns courses and places barbed wire between layers  
- Finishing Crew – applies plaster and surface coatings

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Heavy-duty polypropylene bags, barbed wire, tampers, shovels, water containers, plaster tools, and PPE (gloves, boots, masks). Optional mesh or plaster reinforcement used for external finishing.

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
1. **Foundation Preparation:** Level ground and lay damp-proof membrane or compacted gravel layer.  
2. **Bag Filling:** Fill bags with mixed rubble and soil; maintain consistent moisture for compaction.  
3. **Stacking:** Lay bags in running bond pattern with barbed wire between each course for tension and interlock.  
4. **Tamping:** Compact each course before adding the next layer.  
5. **Finishing:** Apply plaster or render for weather protection; add buttresses for lateral support.  
6. **Inspection:** Verify plumb, compaction, and alignment before plastering.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
The rubble-soil mixture provided excellent compressive strength while maintaining permeability for moisture control. Construction speed increased as crews gained experience, averaging one 3×3 metre wall per day with a six-person team. The wall mass significantly reduced temperature fluctuations inside shelters. Minor issues arose with bag degradation under UV exposure, highlighting the need for timely plastering.

### Safety & Ethics
- PPE mandatory during bag filling and compaction to prevent hand and respiratory injuries  
- Barbed wire handled with caution and protective gloves  
- Training emphasised on safe load handling to prevent back strain  
- Local community participation ensured equitable labour distribution and ownership of reconstruction process

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** 100% manual construction with no heavy equipment; materials sourced from local debris and soil.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Promotes circular use of rubble and soil, reducing environmental impact and providing immediate structural resilience.  
- **Local Adaptation:** Bag and plaster types adjusted based on available supply chains and local climate (e.g., lime plaster in high-salinity zones).

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Load-bearing test performed using simple hydraulic jack setup; compaction density measured periodically; plaster adhesion tests completed after curing.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The earthbag rubble wall approach demonstrates high adaptability, thermal performance, and protection under constrained supply conditions. Future implementations should standardise bag sizing, improve local plaster recipes for UV protection, and integrate pilot workshops to transfer construction knowledge to broader community teams.
