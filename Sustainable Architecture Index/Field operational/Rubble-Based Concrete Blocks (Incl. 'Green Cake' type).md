# Rubble-Based Concrete Blocks (Incl. 'Green Cake' type)

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation documents the process of producing rubble-based concrete blocks, inspired by the locally developed 'Green Cake' initiative. The method reuses crushed concrete rubble and ash as aggregate substitutes to create lightweight masonry units with reduced cement dependency. The aim is to establish a repeatable, low-cost, low-carbon block production system suited for reconstruction in post-conflict environments.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-19  
- **Location:** Northern Gaza Blockworks Cooperative  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Semi-arid Mediterranean, high dust environment with seasonal humidity

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Site Engineer – oversees mix design and curing process  
- Mix Operator – manages material ratios and water content  
- Moulding Crew – fills, compacts, and de-moulds blocks  
- Curing Supervisor – ensures proper hydration and storage

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Block moulds (manual and press types), mixing troughs, shovels, water sprayers, sieves, weighing scales, trowels, and shade netting for curing area.

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
1. **Preparation:** Rubble crushed to <15mm, fines separated, and mixed with limited cement and fly ash (or coal ash if available).  
2. **Mixing:** Dry materials blended thoroughly before adding minimal water for workable consistency.  
3. **Casting:** Mix placed into moulds, compacted manually or by press, then de-moulded carefully.  
4. **Curing:** Blocks covered with damp cloths or misted daily for 7–10 days.  
5. **Quality Checks:** Random samples tested for strength, density, and uniformity before deployment.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
Trial batches showed an average compressive strength of 3.5–5 MPa, suitable for non-load-bearing walls. The inclusion of ash reduced cement use by 30%, improving cost efficiency and sustainability. Surface finish was consistent, and weight reduction improved handling. The cooperative model enabled steady output (400 blocks/day) with high worker participation. Key challenges included moisture retention during curing and variable ash supply.

### Safety & Ethics
- Gloves and masks required during ash handling to avoid respiratory irritation  
- Safe storage of cement and ash to prevent contamination and spillage  
- Community agreements established to share profits and ensure equitable access to blocks  
- Wastewater from mixing recycled for dust control

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** Primarily manual energy, with occasional small generator use for press operation.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Reduced cement content and rubble reuse significantly lower embodied carbon. Supports long-term resilience by establishing local, circular material cycles.  
- **Local Adaptation:** The design process adapted to local ash availability and cultural preferences for lighter wall materials. Demonstrated flexibility in using diverse aggregates (e.g., fine sand or ceramic fines) when ash was scarce.

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Block compressive strength tested on-site using simple hydraulic jigs. Random samples cross-checked by local university lab for consistency.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The 'Green Cake' adaptation highlights how rubble and ash mixtures can enable self-sufficient, sustainable reconstruction. Future work should standardise curing and testing procedures and explore the introduction of natural fibres for tensile reinforcement. Expanding training programmes will ensure local builders can replicate and refine this process independently.
