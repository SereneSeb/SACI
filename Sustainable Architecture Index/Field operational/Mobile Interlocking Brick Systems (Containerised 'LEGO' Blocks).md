# Mobile Interlocking Brick Systems (Containerised 'LEGO' Blocks)

## 🧭 Operation Summary
This operation covers the deployment of a mobile, containerised system for producing interlocking concrete bricks using recycled rubble and minimal cement. Designed as a modular, transportable “factory-in-a-box,” the system enables rapid setup and brick production in disaster or post-conflict reconstruction zones, offering a scalable, low-carbon housing solution.

### 🗓️ Date & Location
- **Date:** 2024-05-20  
- **Location:** Rafah Logistics Hub, Gaza Strip  
- **Region/Climate Zone:** Semi-arid coastal region, subject to intermittent dust storms and high diurnal temperature variation

### 👥 Team & Roles
- Technical Supervisor – oversees machinery setup and mix calibration  
- Machine Operators – manage crusher, mixer, and press operations  
- Logistics Coordinator – tracks output, supplies, and fuel requirements  
- Training Lead – instructs local crews in assembly, operation, and maintenance

## ⚙️ Equipment & Action Plan
### Equipment Used
Containerised mobile unit (with integrated crusher, mixer, and hydraulic brick press), generator (10kVA), hand tools, steel mould trays, fuel reserves, maintenance kit, and protective PPE (ear protection, gloves, masks).

### Automated Action Plan (AAP)
1. **Setup:** Container unit positioned and levelled on site, connected to power or generator.  
2. **Feedstock Prep:** Recycled rubble loaded into crusher, screened to specific particle size.  
3. **Mixing:** Crushed material blended with limited cement (≤8%) and water for optimal cohesion.  
4. **Pressing:** Hydraulic system compresses mix into interlocking hollow blocks.  
5. **Curing:** Blocks stacked under tarps and lightly misted for 7 days before use.  
6. **Quality Control:** Sample blocks tested for compressive strength and dimensional accuracy.

## 🔍 Observations & Findings
Deployment was completed within 48 hours. Daily output reached 1,200–1,500 bricks under stable power conditions. The system proved effective in producing uniform blocks with high interlock precision. Limited fuel supply intermittently disrupted production, highlighting the need for solar integration. Dust and heat required scheduled maintenance and operator rotation. The local workforce adapted quickly, demonstrating the system’s accessibility and training potential.

### Safety & Ethics
- Mandatory PPE and machinery lockout protocols  
- Noise management using ear protection and designated quiet zones  
- Fair wage structure and gender-inclusive hiring for local training sessions  
- Transparent production data shared with community representatives

## 🌱 Sustainability & Adaptation
- **Inputs & Energy:** Primarily rubble-based feedstock; low cement ratio; powered by diesel generator with potential solar hybrid integration.  
- **Sustainability Notes:** Reduces carbon footprint through rubble reuse and decentralised manufacturing. Encourages community participation in circular reconstruction.  
- **Local Adaptation:** Modular design allows quick relocation; components resistant to dust and corrosion; adaptable for local aggregates and variable water quality.

## 🧩 Verification & References
- **Verification Testing:** Compressive strength tests conducted on-site and cross-referenced with ASTM C90 standards. Visual inspection confirmed dimensional tolerance within 2mm variance.

## 🪶 Notes & Next Steps
The pilot run validated the feasibility of containerised mobile brick systems as a scalable solution for rapid housing construction. Next steps include solar power retrofitting, training-of-trainers (ToT) workshops for local operators, and integration into a regional reconstruction network to enable equipment sharing between municipalities.
