## 🧭 Spatial Typologies Bridge Map

This bridge map connects core spatial archetypes observed across the Sustainable Architecture Index. These typologies offer structural and symbolic logics that recur across cultures, climates, and design strategies.

### 🔲 Typologies

- [[Threshold-Centered Space]] — Spaces of ritual passage and sensory transformation.
- [[Modular-Fractal Settlement Form]] — Repetitive, adaptable, and scalable units that compose settlement fabrics.
- [[Earth-Embedded and Climatic Shelter]] — Structures drawing thermal stability and material presence from the terrain.
