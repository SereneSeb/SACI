RIM v2 Classification Pass Summary

This report lists the Markdown concept stubs that were missing one or more of the required fields (rim_layer, modality, sign_type and matrix_zone) and provides a classification based on the **Recursive Interpretant Model (RIM) v2** and the **Modalities–Affect Matrix**. Where files already contained some metadata (e.g. modality or rim_layer), those values were retained and only missing fields were filled in. Classification decisions draw upon definitions from the reference documents, such as **Ren** (affective co‑feeling), **Li** (ritual form), **Yi** (contextual judgement), **Wa** (harmony via suppression), **Anomie**, **Ressentiment**, **Category Erosion** and **Simpatico**[[1]]
