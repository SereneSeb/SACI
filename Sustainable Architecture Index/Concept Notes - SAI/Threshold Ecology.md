# Threshold Ecology

*Concept Category: Relational Threads (Meta)*

Threshold Ecology explores the ecological, symbolic, and social significance of *in-between spaces*—edges where systems meet, change, or dissolve. These thresholds are not only rich in biodiversity but also in cultural meaning and transition.

---

## 🌀 Key Thresholds

- Riverbanks, wetlands, coasts, and tidal zones
- Courtyards, entryways, shared hearths
- Urban-rural fringes and informal settlement edges
- Seasonal and temporal boundaries (dawn, dusk, equinox)

## 🏗️ Examples in the Index

- [[East Kolkata Wetlands]]
- [[Kurashiki Urban Waterways]]
- [[METSÄ Village]]

## ✨ Why It Matters

Edges are where things become possible. Threshold Ecology invites us to design for change, multiplicity, and the sacred space of becoming.
