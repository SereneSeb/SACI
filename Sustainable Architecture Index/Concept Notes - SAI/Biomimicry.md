# Biomimicry

*Concept Category: Ecological Integration*

Biomimicry is the design and engineering of human systems based on biological processes and patterns. In architecture, it offers low-energy, high-function strategies grounded in evolution’s genius.

## 🦎 Key Inspirations

- Termite mounds for passive airflow
- Leaf structure for shading and moisture control
- Mycelial networks for material logic or infrastructure
- Animal burrows for thermal stability

## 🌱 Why It Matters

Nature has already solved most design challenges. Biomimicry makes architecture a student of life, not a master of it.
