# Time-Conscious Design

*Concept Category: Relational Threads (Meta)*

Time-Conscious Design refers to architectural strategies that honor temporal rhythms—seasonal, generational, planetary. It contrasts with linear or disposable timeframes and centers long-term thinking in construction and use.

## ⏳ Temporal Dimensions

- Seasonal temperature flow and light patterns
- Structures meant to age, evolve, and be maintained
- Design that evokes ancestry, ritual cycles, or future legacy
- Biodegradable or repairable material logic
