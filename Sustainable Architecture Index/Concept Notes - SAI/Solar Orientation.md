# Solar Orientation

*Concept Category: Ecological Integration*

Solar Orientation optimizes building alignment with the sun for energy gain, daylighting, and passive heating/cooling. It’s an ancient, site-specific logic with enduring relevance.

## ☀️ Strategies

- East-west alignment for passive solar gain
- South-facing windows in temperate zones
- Overhangs or trellises for seasonal shading

---

## 🏗️ Potential Examples in the Index

- [[South Korean Ondol & Hanok]]
- [[Tamera Solar Village]]
- [[Passive Solar Homes]]

## 🌤️ Why It Matters

The sun is the original architect. Solar orientation aligns structure with celestial rhythm and climate logic.
