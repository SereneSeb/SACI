# Passive Cooling

*Concept Category: Design & Material Practices*

Passive Cooling refers to architectural techniques that reduce indoor temperatures without mechanical systems. It harnesses design elements—like airflow, shading, orientation, and thermal mass—to stabilize climate inside a building.

## ❄️ Core Techniques

- Cross-ventilation and stack effect
- Deep overhangs, courtyards, and verandas
- Use of local thermal mass (adobe, stone)
- Strategic openings and shaded apertures

## 🏗️ Examples in the Index

- [[Eastgate Centre]]
- [[Tierramor Regenerative Village]]
- [[Vauban District]]

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Passive Cooling isn't just energy-efficient—it's poetic. It makes buildings feel alive, responsive to weather, and designed *with* the land instead of against it.
