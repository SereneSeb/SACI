# Urban Rewilding

*Concept Category: Ecological Integration*

Urban Rewilding is the process of restoring biodiversity, ecological function, and natural cycles within cities. It reintroduces wildness—plants, animals, and natural rhythms—into built environments often dominated by concrete and control.

## 🌳 Strategies

- Green roofs, bioswales, and living walls
- Riparian corridor restoration
- Native planting, pollinator zones, and unmanaged habitats
- Animal reintroduction (birds, insects, small mammals)

## 🏗️ Examples in the Index

- [[Green Roofs on Chicago City Hall]]
- [[Xochimilco Floating Gardens]]
- [[One Central Park]]
- [[CopenHill]]
- [[Tierramor Regenerative Village]]

## 🌱 Why It Matters

Cities can be habitats. Urban Rewilding shifts the built environment from dominance to reciprocity, and invites a multispecies future.
