# Community-Based Care Models

*Concept Category: Community & Governance*

Community-Based Care Models are systems of support where caregiving emerges from within the community rather than being delivered solely through institutions. These models value relational continuity, local knowledge, and distributed responsibility—often in response to systemic gaps or collapse.

## 🧭 Why It Matters

These models reimagine care as a collective act—not a transaction. They prioritize presence over protocols, and they recognize vulnerability as a shared foundation for community.
