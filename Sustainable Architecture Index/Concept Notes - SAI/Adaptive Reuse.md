# Adaptive Reuse

*Concept Category: Construction Methods & Materials*

Adaptive Reuse transforms existing buildings into new functions, conserving embodied energy and cultural memory. It’s a practice of reinvention rather than replacement.

## 🔁 Techniques

- Minimal structural change with maximal functional shift
- Retention of original character and materials
- Layering of old and new narratives

## 🏗️ Potential Examples in the Index

- [[Matsunoyama Snow Country School Reuse]]
- [[Dogon Cliff Dwellings]]
- [[Cuban Repair Culture]]

Every building is a story already told. Adaptive reuse listens before it speaks.
