# Climate Adaptation

*Concept Category: Ecological Integration*

Climate Adaptation is the process of adjusting design practices to cope with climate shifts—heatwaves, storms, flooding, and unpredictability.

---

## 🌀 Key Approaches

- Floodable landscapes and amphibious structures
- Passive cooling and thermal resilience
- Fire-resistant materials and layouts
- Flexible zoning and retreat protocols

---

## 🏗️ Potential Examples in the Index

- [[Floating Architecture]]
- [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]]
- [[SuperHub Meerstad]]

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Adaptation is no longer optional. Climate-aware design ensures continuity in unstable futures.
