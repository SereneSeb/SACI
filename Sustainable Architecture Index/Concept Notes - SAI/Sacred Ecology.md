# Sacred Ecology

*Concept Category: Relational Threads (Meta)*

Sacred Ecology describes the worldview that sees ecosystems not just as resources, but as kin, ancestors, and spiritual partners. It informs building practices that integrate reverence, restraint, and ritual into land use and design.

## 🌺 Key Patterns

- Ritual use of natural materials with intention and offering
- Layouts informed by spiritual geography or cosmology
- Design that fosters gratitude, humility, and place-based identity
- Built forms as sites of ceremony or ecological reciprocity

## ✨ Why It Matters

In Sacred Ecology, building is not extraction—it’s relationship. It reclaims reverence in a world of depletion.
