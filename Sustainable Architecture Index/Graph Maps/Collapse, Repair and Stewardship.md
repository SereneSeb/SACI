## 🔥 Summary
This bridge explores the relationship between **systemic collapse**, **repair cultures**, and the design of future stewardship. These are spaces born from breakdown—where architecture becomes a tool not of spectacle, but of survival, restoration, and moral imagination. It ties together adaptive reuse, grassroots resilience, and long-view care infrastructures.
