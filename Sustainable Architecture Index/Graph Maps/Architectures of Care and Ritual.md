## 🌿 Summary
This bridge explores how architecture acts as a vessel for **care**, **ritual**, and **collective presence**. These are spaces where **healing and cultural meaning** are not secondary but central—expressed through **materials, thresholds, symbols**, and **shared routines**. From dementia care villages to sacred gathering houses, these architectures encode rhythm, safety, and spiritual renewal.
