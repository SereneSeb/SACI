## 🧭 Spatial Logic
Derived from repeated, self-contained units that can combine into larger networks without hierarchical imposition.

## 🔲 Core Characteristics
- Each unit has full integrity and autonomy
- Designed to interlock socially and ecologically
- Often follows a hexagonal, radial, or grid logic

## 🌿 Ecological Role
- Reduces sprawl by densifying intelligently
- Supports circular systems (energy, water, food)

## 🧶 Cultural Examples
- [[Wiki House]]
- [[Y:Cube Housing]]
- [[Habitat 67]]

## 🔗 Conceptual Anchors
- [[Circular Economy Architecture]], [[Digital Fabrication]], [[Relational Infrastructure]]
