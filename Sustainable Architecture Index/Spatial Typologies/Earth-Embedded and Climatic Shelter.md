## 🧭 Spatial Logic
Shelters that embed partially or fully into terrain to utilize the earth as a stabilizing envelope.

## 🔲 Core Characteristics
- Thick walls for thermal inertia
- Often low-profile, embedded into slope or berms
- Materials sourced hyper-locally (e.g., adobe, stone, rammed earth)

## 🌿 Ecological Role
- Passive thermal regulation
- Sound insulation and humidity buffering

## 🧶 Cultural Examples
- [[Pembrokeshire Eco Arch]]
- [[TECLA]]
- [[Tierramor Regenerative Village]]

## 🔗 Conceptual Anchors
- [[Earth Construction]], [[Post-Collapse Adaptation]], [[Bioregionalism]]
